Summary:
After over a year, Sunny finally returns to Faraway Town to visit his friends for the Summer. While at the park with Kel, he finds himself too shy to admit that he needs to relieve himself.

整整一年后，Sunny 终于回到了 Faraway Town ，在这个夏天去拜访他的朋友们。但是与 Kel 在公园里时，他发现他自己太害羞了，不能说出他想要释放的需求。

I wrote this back in July on OmoOrg and then deleted it like two days later. If I do that again here, send me a zip bomb as punishment.

Work Text:
Finally, after a full year, a two-hour flight, and nearly three-hour bus ride, Sunny would be able to see his friends again. While he had come to visit the previous summer, he’d only stayed for a single week. Ever since, he’d only been able to talk to them via phone calls. There wasn’t any particular reason for them not meeting up, other than schedules not working out. He’d wanted to come over during winter break, before learning that Kel and Hero would be out of town for almost the entirety of their vacation.

终于，经过一整年后，两小时的飞机，三小时的公交车车程，Sunny 能够再一次看到他的朋友们了。尽管他在前一个夏天来看过一次，他只待了一星期。从那以后，Sunny就只能跟他们电话交流了。他们没有什么特别的原因不见面了，如果有，那就是时间计划有冲突。在寒假时，他就想过来了，但之后得知了 Kel 和 Hero 几乎整个假期都不在本地。

His visit would be a lot like last year’s, except that he would be staying for a full month. He would spend most nights with Hero and Kel, and maybe have a sleepover or two at Basil’s house. He actually hadn’t talked to Basil in a while, but he seemed to be doing well most times they had spoken since he’d moved. Apparently, he’d been working part-time at Fix-It for at least a year now. Sunny had just assumed that Basil had been doing most of his work in the gardening area, but now that he thought about it, he wasn’t sure if he’d actually said that.

他的造访和去年相比，很相似，但是这次会留在这里整一个月。在大多数夜晚，他会跟 Hero 和 Kel 在一起，也许会去 Basil 家里一起过夜一两次。他跟 Basil 有一段时间没有联系了，但是自从他搬家后，他的大多数谈话都发现似乎 Basil 过得很棒。显然，他到现在在 Fix-It 兼职至少一年了。Sunny 只是猜测 Basil 做的大部分工作是一些花事，但是现在他想了想它，他不能确定他是不是这么说过。

After a long ride, most of which was spent gazing out the windows and daydreaming, the bus slowed to a stop at Faraway Park. Sunny, being the only person in the decently-packed bus to get off at this stop, stepped outside and was blasted with a wave of heat and humidity, a strong contrast to the surprisingly well-air-conditioned vehicle. He knew he’d have to walk a short distance once he got off, but he had completely forgotten how warm Faraway gets in the summers compared to the northern city he currently lives in.

在那漫长的公交车程上，Sunny 大多数时间都在看向窗外，做白日梦，然后，公交减速，要在 Faraway Park 停车。Sunny，作为这个装载得体的公交车里的唯一在这一站下车一个人，当他走出车外后，感到了一股潮湿的热浪，与那辆空气质量出奇好的车形成了强烈的对比。他知道他还得再走一小段路，但是他完全忘了，跟他现居的南方城市相比，Faraway Town 在夏天可以变得多么热。

Kel’s house had looked exactly as he’d remembered, same yard decor and all. He began approaching the driveway when Kel burst through the door, shouting Sunny’s name and running in his direction. The door had flung open so fast that it hit the wall with a loud ***SLAM***, leaving a large gash where the impact had occurred. Kel briefly froze in place and processed the sound with a look that screamed, ‘*Oh god fuck I did it again’* before resuming his sprint as if nothing had happened. He tackled Sunny into a bone-crushing hug.

Kel 的家看上去他所记得的一模一样，一样的院子装饰和一切。他正准备进到院子里时，Kel 冲出了门，叫着 Sunny 的名字，向着他的方向跑去。门被突然打开，速度之快让他撞向墙壁，发出了一阵响亮的***撞击声***，在撞击发生地方，留下了一个巨大的裂痕。Kel 稍微在原地楞了一下，因为这个声音，他脸上浮现出的表情在尖叫：“*妈的，我又这么做了”*，然后他就重新开始冲刺，就好像什么都没有发生一样。他给个 Sunny 一个好像能压碎骨头的的拥抱，拦住了 Sunny。

“It’s so good to see you again!” He nearly yelled.

“能再看见你真是太好了！”他几乎在叫喊。

“You too,” Sunny replied quietly, then added, “Congrats on graduating.” He gave Kel a soft smile and looked at him. He’d been wearing a slightly different outfit than what Sunny was used too seeing, sporting a loose, thin T-Shirt with a similar design as the one on his jersey, and a pair of cargo shorts nearly identical to the ones Sunny was wearing.

“我也一样。”Sunny 小声回应，然后补充：“恭喜毕业。”他给了 Kel 一个柔软的微笑，看向他。他的穿着和 Sunny 经常看到的有点不同，一个宽松的薄款的设计和他的那个运动衫很像的 T 恤，和一个与 Sunny 正在穿着的几乎一模一样的工装短裤。

Hero exited the house shortly after Kel, inspecting the damage on the wall. He sighed, then looked at the two of them, clearly holding back a comment about the large crack that Kel was certainly going to have to pay for. “Hey, Sunny. Glad you could make it,” He said with a gentle beam, before motioning for them to come inside.

Hero 在 Kel走后不久，离开了房间，并检查这墙上的损伤。他叹了气，然后看向他俩，很明显在强忍对着这个 Kel 明显有必要为其付出代价的大裂缝发布评论的欲望。“嘿，Sunny。你能来这真是太让我高兴了。”他温和的笑着说，然后示意他们进来。

It still felt odd to Sunny, even after two years. After his confession, Kel had been the first to reach out, just over a month after he’d been discharged from the hospital.

对 Sunny 来说，尽管过了两年，这里的空气还是很古怪。在他坦白后，Kel 成为了他第一个与他联系的人，仅仅只在出院后用了一个月的时间。

‘*I… I don’t think I can forgive you… at least not yet. But, I really care about you, Sunny. You’re still my friend.’*

“*我……我认为我不能原谅你……至少现在不能。但是我真的关心你,Sunny。你还是我的朋友。”*

Kel’s words rang in his head, and even now, recalling them made him tear up slightly. He was terrified when he’d first heard his voice over the phone, having expected the worst. Sunny could barely keep his composure after hearing what Kel had said. Only a mere two weeks passed before another phone call, this time with Hero joining in as well and mirroring Kel’s sentiment.

Kel 的话在 Sunny 的脑中回荡，直到现在，回想起它还是令他有点心碎。在他第一次从电话里听到 Kel 的声音时，他吓坏了，已经做好了最坏的打算，在听到 Kel 说的话时，他几乎不能保持冷静。仅仅过了短短的两周，Sunny 又接到一次电话，这一次 Hero 也加入了对话，复刻了 Kel 的观点。

Aubrey was a different story. Sunny had only spoken to her once since his confession, a few months after the first call with Kel.

Aubrey 有着不一样的剧情。Sunny 只在坦白后跟她联系过一次，就在第一次给 Kel 打电话的几个月后。

‘*I guess… I just didn’t understand how you could **do** that to us. I still **don’t**, honestly. But, when I think about that day at the lake… if you guys hadn’t been there… if Hero hadn’t shown up...’* She paused for a long moment. Sunny could tell, despite her somewhat calm demeanor, that she was struggling to keep her composure as she spoke. ‘*I can’t say I would have reacted better. And you guys were only 12! I was 16 when I…’* Another pause. ‘*I guess… I’m trying to say that I really want to forgive you. I’m still really mad, but I don’t hate you guys. I guess I just need more time.’*

“*我猜……我只是不理解你怎么可以为我们**做**出那种事。我还是**不理解**，说实话。但是，当我想起我们在湖边的那一天……如果你们不在那里……如果 Hero 没有出现……”* 他停了很长时间。Sunny 可以指出，尽管她不知道为什么这么冷静，在她说话时她正在努力保持镇静。“*我不能说我可以做的更好。而且你们才 12 岁！但我在 16 岁的时候……”* 另一次停顿。“*我猜……我在尝试着说我真的想原谅你。我还是很生气，但是我并不恨你们。我只是需要更多的时间。”*

He hadn’t heard a word from her directly since then. Anything that he’d heard about her in the past year and a half was from Kel, who seemed to still talk to her regularly. Last time he mentioned her, it was because she and Kim had been saving up to rent a cheap apartment on the other side of town together. She still lived in Faraway, just not in the same neighborhood. He hoped he’d get a chance to see her sometime this summer, if she would be okay with seeing him again. He’d likely need Kel to ask her about it first. He wondered if Kel had even mentioned that Sunny would be in town.

从那以后，Aubray 就没有跟他说过一句话了。 Sunny 对过去一年听到的她的消息，有一半都是 Kel 告诉的。Kel 似乎还是在跟 Aubray 定期闲聊。上一次 Kel 提到她，是因为她和 Kim 一直在攒钱，准备在小镇另一边租一间便宜的公寓。她还是生活在 Farwary Town，只是邻居不一样了。Sunny希望他会有机会在这个夏天看她一次，如果再去见到她时让她不介意的话。Sunny 很可能需要 Kel 先去问问她。Sunny 怀疑 Kel 是否 Kel 是否提到过 Sunny 会到城镇里来。

“We’re going to be heading to the mall a few towns over in a little bit. Do you need anything, Sunny?” He was snapped back into reality by Hero. After taking a moment for the words to register in his mind, he looked up and shook his head with a gentle smile. Hero continued, “Kel said he wanted to stay here. I figured you’d want to stay as well, but you’re free to come along if you’d like.”

“我们过一会要去几个城镇外的一个购物广场。你要买什么吗，Sunny?”他思绪被英雄打断，回到了现实。理解 Hero 的话花了一会，然后抬起头，微笑着摇了摇头。Hero 继续说：“Kel 说了他想待在这里，我猜你也想待在这里，但是如果你想的话，你也可以跟过来。”

“I think I’ll stay here,” he replied politely, to which Kel cheered.

“我认为我会待在这里。” Sunny 礼貌地回答，这令 Kel 欢呼。

They spent the next 30 minutes chatting and catching up, Sunny learning that Hero had changed his major and that Kel had started applying for jobs now that he’d finished school. Afterward, Kel began suggesting things they could do together after everyone else left. Sunny nodded at each suggestion, but Kel seemed to notice that he already had something in mind.

他们花了 30 分钟来聊天，了解近况， Sunny 得知 Hero 转了专业，Kel 现在完成了学业，已经在找工作了。后来 Kel 开始建议当别人走后，他们两个可以干什么。Sunny 同意了每一个提意，但是 Kel 好像注意到了 Sunny 已经想好了要做什么。s

“It’s up to you, though, Sunny!” He said with a smile, “What do you want to do?”

“取决于你，Sunny！” Kel 带着笑容说到：“你想做什么？”

Sunny paused for a moment, before suggesting, “I was thinking we could go to the park?” Seeing the park after getting off the bus had made him nostalgic, and he’d been hoping they would go there sometime soon. He hadn’t expected an opportunity to go today, but he definitely wanted to.

Sunny 停了一会，在提出建议前，“我觉得我们可以去公园？”在下公交后看见公园让 Sunny 怀念过去。有时间的话，他想要去那里。他真的没有预料到今天就能有机会去那里，但是他绝对想要有。

“That sounds great! Let’s go now!” Kel exclaimed as he grabbed Sunny’s hand and sprang up off the couch. He began charging toward the door.

“听上去真棒！让我们去吧！”Kel 叫喊着，拉起 Sunny 的手，跳下沙发，开始对着门冲刺。

“Hold on, Kel.” Hero said sternly, and Kel froze mid-sprint in an exaggerated running pose. “It’s really hot out today. Make sure you grab a couple water bottles before you leave. You guys need to stay hydrated.”

“Uuuuugggghhhhh, fiiiiiinneeeee” Kel jokingly groaned, before dramatically shuffling toward the kitchen. He returned a minute later with two 1-liter water bottles, and handed one to Sunny.

Sunny opened the bottle and took a small sip, before realizing just how dry his mouth was. He thought back to earlier, and realized he hadn’t really drank anything since he woke up that morning. The walk from the bus stop probably didn’t help him retain his hydration, either. He took a large gulp, then another, and another, until he had drank everything in the bottle, finally feeling refreshed. Kel stared at him in disbelief.

“Wowww…” Kel spoke, seeming unsure of what else to say. He paused for a moment, before saying, “Sorry… I should have offered to get you something to drink. Don’t be afraid to let me know if you need anything!” Kel seemed to think that Sunny had simply been too shy to ask for a drink. He thought about correcting him, but realized that he probably would have been had he realized how thirsty he actually was. He opted instead to reply with a thankful, “Okay,” before walking to the kitchen to refill his bottle.

As Sunny was exiting the kitchen, Kel dashed up to him and once again grabbed his hand, pulling him toward the door. He suddenly stopped, opening the door very gently as his parents watched him like eagles, making sure the door didn’t touch the damaged wall. He and Sunny walked outside calmly before Kel SLAMMED the door shut at full force. Sunny genuinely couldn’t tell if he intended to slam it or if it was somehow an accident. The two of them began walking down the sidewalk and in the direction of the park.

After rounding the corner and approaching the crosswalk, Kel suddenly perked up and, yet again, grabbed Sunny’s hand. He braced himself to be dragged as if he were walking a large dog who had just seen a squirrel for the first time. Instead, Kel just pointed excitedly at the vending machine on the other side of the street with a massive grin on his face.

“They finally started restocking the park’s vending machine again!” He spoke, bubbling with an excitement that Sunny couldn’t help but find adorable. He smiled more widely than he had in a while at Kel’s contagious joy.

“How come?” He asked, still grinning.

“I emailed the park managers every day for three months!” He replied, not breaking his energetic tone. The two of them crossed the street and began approaching it. Kel pulled a few dollar bills from his pocket, and put them into the machine, which deposited two cans. “Want one?” He asked, now holding an Orange Joe in each hand. Sunny wished he had asked before buying him one. He couldn’t just decline the drink now, could he..? Reluctantly, he nodded. “Here, you can just have this one.” Kel said as he held out the can in his left hand. Sunny grabbed and opened it.

He watched as Kel opened his and chugged the entire can in one gulp, letting out a refreshed ‘ahh’ as he lowered it away from his face. Sunny took a small sip of the vile concoction, trying his absolute best to hide his raw disgust. How the hell did Kel drink this stuff? He proceeded to chug the whole can, much like Kel had, but for the complete opposite reason. He wanted to finish it as fast as possible. After swallowing the last gulp, he couldn’t stop himself from physically retching, causing Kel to rush over to him in concern.

“Whoa, are you okay?” He asked, and Sunny nodded as he regained his composure. He took multiple large swigs of his water to help wash away the aftertaste. He looked at Kel and noticed a third, newly-purchased can in his hand, and the realization finally hit him.

Oh. He had bought two for himself, and had been offering to buy a third one for Sunny.

The two of them decided to sit on a nearby bench. The park wasn’t packed, but there were still quite a few people around, as per usual. It was only as they sat down did Sunny finally notice the slight, building pressure in his abdomen. He had been drinking quite a bit since he got here. A liter of water, a can of hell coffee, and then another half-liter to wash away the taste of said coffee. His need wasn’t too bad yet, but he knew it would probably be best to tell Kel relatively soon. He didn’t want to just bring it up out of nowhere, though, especially when there were so many people around. He decided he would wait for a good opportunity to bring it up, although he was unsure what a ‘good opportunity’ would actually be. Maybe if they went to the shopping center later? They would walk by- No, Sunny remembered, none of the Othermart stores had customer restrooms, for some reason. He decided to just try to stop thinking about it. After all, he didn’t need to go that badly yet.

…

“Wanna go to the secret spot?” Kel whispered to him after about an hour of chatting, bouncing his legs in what Sunny assumed was excitement, even though he had seemed pretty calm while they had sat down. He nodded, and the two of them walked to the other end of the park. The pressure in his bladder was becoming more and more difficult to ignore, but still couldn’t bring himself to say anything. Kel looked around to make sure nobody would see them, before climbing into the trees and entering the hidden path. Sunny wondered if the hideout really was a ‘secret’ anymore. After all, Aubrey’s friend group all knew about it, and he doubted that all of them would be able to keep it to themselves. However, the spot was completely empty when they arrived, just like always.

“Perfect.” Kel said, lightly bouncing in place. “To be honest, I just really need to take a leak, and I wanted to get away from everyone there.”

“Oh…” Sunny muttered with a nervous awkwardness, unsure of what to say. He walked away from where Kel stood, not wanting to hear his friend urinating for a multitude of reasons. He waited on the opposite side of the clearing, subtly pressing his thighs together. He considered trying to pee here like Kel, but he really didn’t want to. Even if he did, he doubted he’d be able to. He could barely manage using public bathrooms, even if nobody was in there but him. His shy bladder definitely wouldn’t allow him to go outside if he could avoid it.

Sunny knew that of all times, this would probably be the best to alert Kel of his growing need. When Kel finished, he walked over to the edge of the dock and sat down. Sunny, reluctantly, joined him. He had conquered his fear of water, to an extent, but being this close to the lake still made him anxious. Especially this particular lake, given everything that had happened here. His bladder, now requiring a large amount of focus in his mind, didn’t exactly calm his nerves either. His anxiety began to dissipate, however, when he felt Kel’s head suddenly resting on his shoulder.

His hair felt soft and comfortable. Kel had never done anything like this with Sunny, but it felt nice. He reciprocated, turning and placing his cheek atop Kel’s head. He could feel his body shaking, mostly with desperation, and prayed that Kel wouldn’t notice. He crossed his legs tightly and decided he would wait. He didn’t want to ruin the moment, and he didn’t want to leave yet.

Only a few minutes passed without a word from either of them, Sunny growing more and more desperate with each passing second. He decided he would try to move to a position that put less strain on his now bulging bladder. As he began to move, Kel had begun to say something, but was cut off by a sudden gasp from Sunny as a pulse of desperation ran through him, and a small stream of urine escaped into his boxers. Kel sat up and looked at him, concerned, before immediately realizing what was happening as Sunny fought with all his might to regain control without grabbing and holding himself.

Kel helped the now trembling Sunny stand up slowly, apologizing profusely for not paying attention. He stuttered the words, “It’s okay,” as Kel began leading him gently toward the treeline. Kel must have realized that Sunny wouldn’t be able to relieve himself unless they were in a bathroom, because the two of them went straight toward the path to the park and began heading in the direction of the house. The sun was beginning to set, and the park was empty, much to Sunny’s relief. He couldn’t let anyone else see him like this. It was already humiliating enough with Kel, even if he knew he held no judgment.

“I know you might not want to, but it might help take off some of the pressure if you unbutton your shorts,” Kel suggested, clearly trying to phrase the sentence in the least awkward way possible, “I had to do it earlier when we were walking to the clearing.” If that were true, Sunny hadn’t noticed. He was hesitant, but there was no one around who would see him if he followed Kel’s advice. Reluctantly, he reached down and attempted to remove the button as gently as possible so as to not accidentally poke his bladder. He was certain that doing so at this point would cause him to burst.

After the agonizing trek home, Sunny had dropped all pretenses of trying to hide his desperation. Unbuttoning his pants had helped, but so slightly that it barely mattered. He was bursting, and couldn’t wait another minute. The two walked up to the door, and Sunny reached down and turned the knob as fast as he could. When he pushed the door forward, it didn’t budge.

“Ahhh... they uh, must have locked it when they left…” Kel said nervously, frantically fishing through his pockets and muttering, “Oh god” over and over. He stopped suddenly and looked at Sunny in a panic, now having to explain to the boy grabbing himself with both hands and hopping from foot-to-foot that he didn’t have his house key. Kel immediately pulled a flip-phone out of his pocket and rapidly dialed a number.

“Hero?” He said in a frantic tone, “Hey, are you guys going to be home soon?”

…

“We- well, we’re locked out and- uh, we- we really need to get inside!”

…

“N-no, we’re okay, just-” Kel turned his head toward Sunny, who was now pacing in circles, scared that if he stopped moving he would flood his shorts in seconds. “I- uh, I really need to use the bathroom, is all.”

…

“O-okay… Thanks anyway…” He hung up without saying anything else and started leading Sunny to the backyard. He let go of Sunny’s arm and rushed to the back door, likely knowing that it, too, would be locked, then ran back to Sunny. “They’re not going to be back for at least another 40 minutes. Our only option is to try going out here.” By now, Kel seemed nearly as panicked as he did. “I’m sorry, Sunny.”

The desperate boy tried to contemplate the choice, but a large spurt of urine escaping into his shorts helped him realize that if he didn’t at least try, he would absolutely, fully wet himself. Kel promised wholeheartedly that he wouldn’t look, and Sunny began shuffling further into the treeline, hoping to find a secluded spot when he completely began losing control of his bladder, urine soaking through his underwear and into his pants in seconds. In a panic, he pulled down his already unbuttoned shorts and pulled himself out, finally allowing himself to just relax, tears now forming in his eyes.

He couldn’t help but moan as he released the nearly two liters of liquid he’d drank that built up inside him over three hours. His face felt red hot and he could guarantee he was blushing harder than he ever had before, but any shame or embarrassment he could feel was completely overridden by the feeling of pure euphoria as he continued to release the pressure in his bladder. It took everything he had to stop himself from crying with sheer relief.

His stream finally began to slow after nearly a full minute and a half. He was amazed by just how much he had managed to hold. Despite now being completely empty, he couldn’t stop himself from trembling and shaking, and had to fight to stay upright and keep from collapsing to his knees where he stood. After a moment spent gathering himself, he looked down to put himself away and realized just how soaked his shorts were. He hadn’t completely wet himself, but you certainly wouldn’t get that impression by looking at him. An immense feeling of embarrassment began to wash over him as he zipped up his shorts. He turned around to face Kel, hanging his head in shame. Kel approached apologetically.

“I’m so sorry, man…” Kel whispered. Sunny could tell that he had absolutely no idea what to say. “It’ll be okay. It’s not your fault.”

“They’re going to see me when they get back” Sunny muttered, stifling sobs. “A- and it is my fault... I didn’t tell you until it was too late.”

The two of them sat together, hidden in the trees, while Kel was doing everything he could to comfort the poor boy who was doing everything in his power to stop himself from crying. After a few minutes, Sunny had managed to calm down somewhat, but was still filled with shame over having wet himself when he was supposed to be a full-grown adult, and terrified of Kel’s family inevitably seeing him in this state. Kel tried to reassure him that they wouldn’t judge him, that they would understand, but it wasn’t helping. He hesitated, before speaking.

“Y’know, we’re... basically wearing the same shorts… They look almost identical. And, I told Hero that I was the one who needed to go to the bathroom when we were on the phone…” Sunny had to stop to process what Kel was suggesting. He didn’t seem to just be blurting this out without a second thought, so he certainly realized just how odd it had sounded. “I- uh, maybe… I should take the blame? I think I can deal with it…” Both boys were obviously embarrassed, and an aura of awkwardness surrounded them. Despite it, Sunny really wanted to accept Kel’s… offer? But, did he really need to say what Kel was implying?

“You… would have to wear my shorts…” He stated. “Are… are you really okay with that?” He was trying to be as blunt as possible while not increasing the sense of awkwardness and… not embarrassment, but… a feeling he couldn’t really describe. Almost like what he felt earlier, when they sat at the dock together. Except much, much more nerve-wracking.

“I, uh… I think I can deal with it…” He repeated, then added with the most awkward and forced smile Sunny had ever seen from him “Just for you.” He very clearly regretted saying that last part immediately as the words left his mouth. Sunny’s face softened as he exhaled and released tension in his shoulders that he didn’t even notice he’d had. Kel did the same after seeing Sunny relax.

“Thank you, Kel.”

-----

Sunny donned the dry shorts over his damp underwear. He was worried that the liquid still clinging to his boxers would come through and show on Kel’s clothes, but much to his relief, it didn’t. Kel’s shorts were a size too big for Sunny, but he didn’t really mind. He hoped that his shorts weren’t too small for Kel. If they were, Kel didn’t say anything, and they certainly looked as if they fit him decently enough. Now, all they could do was wait for Kel’s family to return. He eagerly awaited the opportunity to take a shower and put on some clean, unsoaked clothes and imagined that Kel probably wanted to do the same.

Sunny really felt as if there was something he should say to Kel, beyond just expressing his gratitude at what his friend had been willing to do for him, but he just couldn’t figure out what it was. In return, Kel also seemed as if he were thinking something, but didn’t know how to say it. Neither of them said anything for a while, letting the tension build. Only after Hero’s car began pulling into the driveway did Sunny realize what it was he wanted to say.

He quickly pulled Kel into a hug, and whispered, “I love you,” so quietly that he wasn’t sure if he had been heard in the proceeding moments of silence, before...

“I love you too, Sunny.”
