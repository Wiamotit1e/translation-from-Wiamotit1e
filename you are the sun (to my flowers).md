Basil remembered Mari’s words to him years ago. He had, what some people say, “came out” to her, and told her about his crush on Sunny. 

BAsil 回忆起了几年前，Mari 对他说过的话。Basil （按照某些人的说法）对 Mari 出柜了，告诉了 Mari 对 Sunny 的暗恋。
 

*‘ If you decide to date a boy, Sunny or not, I’ll be by your side to support you. As long as you are good to them and they’re good to you, I don’t care who you decide to love. ’*

*“如果你决定约会，无论是不是跟 Sunny，我永远会在你的一边支持你的。只要你们对他好，他也对你好，我就不会在意你想喜欢谁。”*
 

But… Has he really been good to Sunny? He had made things worse trying to cover up what Sunny did to his sister. He tried to convince Sunny to do a double suicide, and when Sunny didn't comply, he fully broke down and tried to kill him! That wasn't healthy! Mari never would have expected that Sunny would push her, and he was damn sure that she wouldn't have expected Basil’s ‘remedy’ for that. He didn't deserve to be with someone, and Sunny was that someone. He didn't want to hurt Sunny again, but he knew that given some time, he would make another awful mistake…

但是……他真的对 Sunny 好吗？他曾尝试掩饰 Sunny 对他的姐姐做的事，他曾尝试说服 Sunny 双双自杀，在 Sunny 没有答应时，他完全崩溃了，甚至尝试杀了他！这不健康！Mari 绝对不会想到 Sunny 会推他，他很确信，Mari 也想不到 Basil 是怎样“补救”的。他永远没有资格去跟某人在一起，尤其是和 Sunny。他不想再伤害 Sunny 了，但是 Basil 也知道，只要再过一段时间，他会造成另一个可怕的错误。 
 

Still, a part of him, a voice that sounded like Mari’s, reassured him that things would be okay, for real this time. He had improved significantly in the past year, and so had Sunny. Maybe, just maybe, if Sunny and him continued to get better, they could possibly have a future together.

不变的是，他的一部分，他那和 Mari 一样的声音，让他相信一切都会变好。Basil 过去一年改变了很多，Sunny 也改变了很多。也许，只是也许，如果他们不断变好，他们就可能会拥有共同的未来。
 

Basil looked up at Sunny with wet, wanting , eyes. “Sunny… K-Kiss me.”

Basil 看着 Sunny，用湿润而渴望的眼神。“Sunny……亲我。”
 

So Sunny did, he kissed Basil like there was no tomorrow. Perhaps Sunny had also felt this way for a long time…?

Sunny 照做了，他亲吻了 Basil，就好像世界上没有明天了一样。也许 Sunny 很久就想要这样做了吧。


Basil couldn't be sure, but all he knew was that his worries began to slip away as he finally got to kiss the boy he had loved for so long. And for the first time in years , Basil felt at home. And this time, it was in Sunny’s arms.

Basil 不能确定，他知道的只是他的担忧飘走了，就在他终于成功的吻到了那个他已经爱了很久的男孩时。在这一年的第一天，Basil 感觉到了家的感觉。而这次，家就在 Sunny 的怀里。
